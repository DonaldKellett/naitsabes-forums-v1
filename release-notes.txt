# Naitsabes Forums v1 - forums.naitsabes.com

## Overview

So, this is my very first attempt at making anything close to a real and working Forums where you can create your own account, create threads, comment on them and manage other Forum members if your rank is high enough.  To accomplish this, I had to have a good knowledge of PHP and SQL and understand how to use PHP to manipulate SQL databases (which took me quite a while to figure out :p).

Since this is my very first attempt at creating a real PHP-MySQL Forums, this Forum platform lacks a few key features.  For example, published threads and comments cannot be edited through any service provided by the Forums; you must edit the database directly (use phpMyAdmin or equivalent).  Form security within the Forums is also not guaranteed (although I have tried my best) so if you decide to use my Forum platform for your own purposes and your website ends up being hacked by some hacker through SQL injection, XSS or any other method(s), I will NOT take any responsibility for it.  This forum was meant for my own use anyway, but since I'm saving it on GitHub, I thought: why not release it as a platform?

## Customisation

### Part I - Linking the platform to your selected database

In ```connect.php```, you will see the following line of code:

```php
$conn = new mysqli("localhost", "root", "root", "forums");
```

To connect it to your database instead, change "localhost" to the name of your server (e.g. example.com), the first "root" to a valid username in the SQL system, the second "root" to a valid password in the SQL system and "forums" to the name of your database (for simplicity, you could also name your database "forums" and not change the code).

### Part II - Creating the Tables

In order for the Forums to work, you will need 3 tables - ```accounts```, ```threads``` and ```comments```.

To create these 3 tables, first go to ```dbinfo.txt```.  There, you will see three SQL statements, one for each table.  Just copy all 3 SQL statements in your selected database and execute them.

### Part III - Setting up an Admin account

If you decide to use this platform for your own personal Forums, you would probably want to be an administrator of this Forum yourself.  To do that, first visit ```register.php``` in your browser and register yourself a Forum account.  However, after your account is created, since all accounts start with rank 2 (i.e. Member) by default, you will have to manually edit the SQL database.  Go to the selected database, then go to the ```accounts``` table.  You should see your account created.  After that, you should change the ```rank``` of your Forum account from 2 (Member) to 5 (Administrator).  Your Forums is ready to go!
